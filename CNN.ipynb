whatever CNN architecture you'd like on CIFAR-10. Your model should be able to **achieve at least 75% validation accuracy** within 10-20 epochs.\n","\n","This [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-beginner-blitz-cifar10-tutorial-py) will walk you through the process of training a CNN classifier using PyTorch. The model used in this tutorial, however, is too simple for our purpose. To conveniently create a deeper model, you can use [`nn.Sequential()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.7.0/generated/torch.nn.Sequential.html#torch.nn.Sequential) to stack multiple layers together. You can use built-in layers in the [`torch.nn`](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.7.0/nn.html) package, or you can develop custom layers. All custom layers should subclass [`nn.Module`](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.7.0/generated/torch.nn.Module.html#torch.nn.Module).\n","\n","### Things you might try\n","- **Network architecture**: [VGG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) can be a good starting point. Keep in mind that this model is designed for ImageNet, which is much larger and have a different image resolution than CIFAR-10. You need to make some adaptations. For example, you may tweak the number of layers and number of channels. [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) and [DenseNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) are also good architectures to try.\n","- **Batch normalization**: You can conveniently add batch normalization layers using [`nn.BatchNorm2d()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.7.0/generated/torch.nn.BatchNorm2d.html#torch.nn.BatchNorm2d). Does your model train faster with batch normalization?\n","- **Optimizer**: The [`torch.optim`](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.7.0/optim.html) package implements many optimization algorithms that you can try, such as [SGD](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.7.0/optim.html#torch.optim.SGD), [Adam](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.7.0/optim.html#torch.optim.Adam), and [RMSprop](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.7.0/optim.html#torch.optim.RMSprop).\n","- **Regularization**: You may use weight decay or [Dropout](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.7.0/generated/torch.nn.Dropout.html#torch.nn.Dropout) to reduce overfitting.\n","- **Activation**: In addition to [ReLU](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.7.0/generated/torch.nn.ReLU.html#torch.nn.ReLU), some recent papers also use [ELU](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.7.0/generated/torch.nn.ELU.html#torch.nn.ELU) and [GELU](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.7.0/generated/torch.nn.GELU.html#torch.nn.GELU). Can they improve your model's performance?\n","- **Pooling vs Strided Convolution**: Similar to pooling, strided convolution can reduce the spatial size of feature maps. However, strided convolution contains learnable parameters, which make the model more flexible. Does strided convolution lead to improved performance?\n","- **Flattening vs Global Average Pooling**: [GoogLeNet](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43022.pdf), [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), and [DenseNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) all use global average pooling followed by a single linear layer to produce the class probabilities from the last feature map. How does this compare to the traditional approach of flattening the last feature map and then having several fully connected layers?\n","\n","### Tips for training\n","For each network architecture that you try, you should tune the learning rate and other hyperparameters using the validation set.
